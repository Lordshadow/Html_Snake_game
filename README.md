Hello visitor! :)

This is my first game, and I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I know what you might be thinking â€“ even though it's a basic and simple snake game, I am really proud to say that this is my first ever game developed in HTML. It marks my first step into the world of game development, and I'm truly happy to share it with you all.

I have attached all the necessary files, along with a screenshot and a sample video of the game. I hope you will play it and enjoy it!

Thank you for your visit.
